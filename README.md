# Data-Analysis-in-Materials-Characterization-MS604-Faculty-Prof.-Rajeev-Gupta

Executed microstructural characterization, mechanical evaluation, electrical resistivity, dielectric testing,
thermogravimetric analysis, and XRD to assess material performance for engineering applications.
∗ Utilized Origin, Excel, and MATLAB for data visualization, trend analysis, and statistical validation to
support material design and process optimization.
Investigated structure–property relationships (hardness, ductility, conductivity, thermal stability) to guide the de-
velopment of advanced metals, alloys, and ceramics for industrial use.
